# James_Coleby_Portfolio Project

This is a readme file for my portfolio project, it's part of my bootcamp course and will serve it's purpose many times over. This portfolio will showcase my skills and talents to employers when I am applying to part-time or full-time roles.

My goal here is to highlight my strongest projects (3-5) and the problems they'll solve by me creating them. I'll be applying the skills I've learn't in my skills bootcamp (Trilogy,Edx) as well as the ones I developed in my study/spare time outside of the skills bootcamp.

There will be four sections in this README file covering: About Me, Work, Contact ME, and CV. In addition to these sections I'll also include my five best projects to show off to the world and employers.
