# James_Coleby_Portfolio Project

This is a readme file for my portfolio project, it's part of my bootcamp course and will serve it's purpose many times over. This portfolio will showcase my skills and talents to employers when I am applying to part-time or full-time roles.

My goal here is to highlight my strongest projects (3-5) and the problems they'll solve by me creating it. I'll be applying the core skills I've learnt in this course and the new skills I've learnt along the way by building various projects.
